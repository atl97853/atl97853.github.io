        <p>
            The idea of this blog is to write about myself, 
            <br>but mainly focused on my progress studying computer science,  
            <br>data science, and to practice my english.</p>

        <p>I am trying to understand Double-Dispatch, and here we go, this explanation is helping me to clarify the idea in my mind:</p>
        <p>We could solve a binary operation using a functional programming approach, that is using a method with if and else statements to determine what's the data type of the argument passed in the method</p>
        <p>But instead, we are using am OOP approach: </p>
        <p>Instead of asking what kind of thing V is, we are calling a method on V</p>
        <p>We are going to call a method on V <br>
            and have it to do the addition <br>
            telling what kind of thing we are <br>
            and this must be solve using a "self" keyword <br>
        </p>
        <p>This is the idea that I started to have in my mind to understand this, I will come back later when I have finished understanding how it works</p>
        <h3 style="color: aqua;">I wrote my first double dispatch code on my own!!! 12:13 a.m.</h3>

        <p>entry 12/04</p>
        <p>Hello world, this is my first entry, I just created this blog.</p>
        <p>I will try to have at least one entry every three days, just to update
            how I am going*, and what topic I already finished. Right now I am studying 
            Programming Languages, Part C. <br>
            It has been very interesting, It has been the first time that I am studying 
            OOP at this depth. I am struggling a bit trying to understand how Double Dispatch works. 
            <br>*yeah, sometimes I will have some esl typos or a very strange way to write.
