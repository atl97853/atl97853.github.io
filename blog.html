            The idea of this blog is to write about myself, 
            <br>but mainly focused on my progress studying computer science,  
            <br>data science, and to practice my english.</p>

        <p>I have a lot to write, Programming Languages part C week 2 and week 3 (CS), and a project that I am doing in c++ for my structured programming class (DS)</p>
        <p>. . . </p>

        <p>I have some homework about 2D Arrays in c++ for one of my data science classes, It is my first time coding in this PL</p>
        <p>I would have liked to wait longer until I had reviewed it in one of my CS courses</p>
        <p>
            Some of my previous knowledge about how static, dynamic and oop PL works have helped me to understand how programming works in cpp , I am struggling more with the syntax, <br>
            cpp idioms and its programing style

        <p>I am trying to understand Double-Dispatch, and here we go, this explanation is helping me to clarify the idea in my mind:</p>
        <p>We could solve a binary operation using a functional programming approach, that is using a method with if and else statements to determine what's the data type of the argument passed in the method</p>
        <p>But instead, we are using am OOP approach: </p>
        <p>Instead of asking what kind of thing V is, we are calling a method on V</p>
        <p>We are going to call a method on V <br>
            and have it to do the addition <br>
            telling what kind of thing we are, (and we know that!) <br>
            and this must be solved using a "self" keyword <br>
        </p>
        <p>This is the idea that I started to have in my mind to understand this, I will come back later when I have finished understanding how it works</p>

        <p>Hello world, this is my first entry, I just created this blog.</p>
        <p>I will try to have at least one entry every three days, just to update
            how I am going*, and what subject I already finished. Right now I am studying 
            Programming Languages, Part C. <br>
            It has been very interesting, It has been the first time that I am studying 
            OOP at this depth. I am struggling a bit trying to understand how Double Dispatch works. 
            <br>*yeah, sometimes I will have some esl typos or a very strange way to write.
