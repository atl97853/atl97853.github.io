            <p>Prototype Chain, Essentially, this is how JavaScript makes use of prototype - by having the objects contain a value - 
            to point to prototypes and inheriting from those prototypes, and thus forming a chain. This kind of inheritance using 
            prototypes is hence named as Prototypal inheritance. JavaScript figures out which properties exist (or do not exist) on 
            the object and starts traversing the chain to find the property or function, However, this chain does not go on forever, 
            and if you have already tried logging the value of Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.prototype), you would find that it is null, 
            which indicates the end of the chain.

                Static does not mean that it will not respond to user actions, These Websites are called static because these cannot be manipulated on the server or interact with databases (which is the case in Dynamic Websites).

                Software engineers know from painful experience that any change to a large or complex program is dangerous
            </p>
            <p>
                We programmers need all the help we can get, and we should never assume otherwise. Careful design is great. Testing is great. Formal methods are great. Code reviews are great. Static analysis is great. But none of these things alone are sufficient to eliminate bugs: They will always be with us. A bug can exist for half a century despite our best efforts to exterminate it. We must program carefully, defensively, and remain ever vigilant.

            <p>I have some homework about 2D Arrays in c++ for one of my data science classes, It is my first time coding in this PL</p>
            <p>I would have liked to wait longer until I had reviewed it in one of my CS courses</p>
            <p>
                Some of my previous knowledge about how static, dynamic and oop PL works have helped me to understand how programming works in cpp , I am struggling more with the syntax, <br>
                cpp idioms and its programing style

            <p>I am trying to understand Double-Dispatch, and here we go, this explanation is helping me to clarify the idea in my mind:</p>
            <p>We could solve a binary operation using a functional programming approach, that is using a method with if and else statements to determine what's the data type of the argument passed in the method</p>
            <p>But instead, we are using am OOP approach: </p>
            <p>Instead of asking what kind of thing V is, we are calling a method on V</p>
            <p>We are going to call a method on V <br>
                and have it to do the addition <br>
                telling what kind of thing we are, (and we know that!) <br>
                and this must be solved using a "self" keyword <br>
            </p>
            <p>This is the idea that I started to have in my mind to understand this, I will come back later when I have finished understanding how it works</p>

            <p>Hello world, this is my first entry, I just created this blog.</p>
            <p>I will try to have at least one entry every three days, just to update
                how I am going*, and what subject I already finished. Right now I am studying 
                Programming Languages, Part C. <br>
                It has been very interesting, It has been the first time that I am studying 
                OOP at this depth. I am struggling a bit trying to understand how Double Dispatch works. 
                <br>*yeah, sometimes I will have some esl typos or a very strange way to write.
