        <p>
            The idea of this blog is to write about myself, 
            <br>but mainly focused on my progress studying computer science,  
            <br>data science, and to practice my english.</p>

        <p>entry 12/04</p>
        <p>Hello world, this is my first entry, I just created this blog.</p>
        <p>I will try to have at least one entry every three days, just to update
            how I am going*, and what topic I already finished. Right now I am studying 
            Programming Languages, Part C. <br>
            It has been very interesting, It has been the first time that I am studying 
            OOP at this depth. I am struggling a bit trying to understand how Double Dispatch works. 
            <br>*yeah, sometimes I will have some esl typos or a very strange way to write.
