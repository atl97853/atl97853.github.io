                Sometimes i have to remind myself that i'm not only studying computer science on my own, but also a data science degree at a local university, I'm not a big fan of data science right now, I chose that career when I was just starting to learn programming and I didn't know anything about this field... for now I'll just stop studying cs 61b, and try to finish all my projects and assignments for my classes for my data science degree, i don't want to do this, but i have no other options, but still, i hope it's just for a week. 
                The classes i have to finish are discrete mathematics, statistics and systemic approach. 
                There is something wrong with me, i prefer to learn in english than in my native language, i was planning to take 
                <a href="https://www.eecs70.org/">cs70</a> after finishing cs61b but i think i will start studying it right now, i have already printed out all the material 
                i need to learn, i refuse to learn using the resources that are in my native language, 
                i will dedicate all my time to cs70 and systemic approach, at the moment i have no idea how to study statistics, 
                i will leave it until the end, i have until december 18th to hand in all my assignments, i hope i can finish as soon as possible and go back to studying cs61b and algorithms

		    Writing tons of code all at once is going to lead to misery.
		    If you wrote too much stuff and feel overwhelmed, comment out whatever is unnecesarry. 
		    If your first try goes badly, don't be afraid to scrap your code and start over.

                "When you are trying to implement some high-level data structure using basic building 
                blocks, the choice of the building blocks that you use, your instance variables, 
                will deeply affect the complexity of your code and its performance in ways that are just
                so important."
		<br>
		The lesson to take away is that initial design decisions 
		determine our code complexity and runtime.
